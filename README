* Thesis Abstract

With the emergence of cloud computing and mobile applications, 
it is possible to find a web service for almost everything. 
Moreover, developers can create complex applications by combining 
several independent services, 
whose arrangement and execution can be automated with the aid of orchestration languages. 
Nevertheless, the diversity of technologies and the lack of standardization 
can hinder the collaboration between services.
An example of this limitation is the case of photo management
with services such as Flickr and Picasa,
which not only differ on the way photos are organized,
but also in the services they provide.
The heterogeneity of the two services leads to interoperability problems,
namely adaptation, integration and coordination problems.

We propose a framework for helping at the resolution of these issues, 
in the form of an architecture that integrates different orchestration 
languages with heterogeneous service providers around a pivot language.

As a pivot language we propose an orchestration language 
based on the chemical programming paradigm.

Concretely, this dissertation presents the language Criojo
that implements and extends the Heta-calculus, 
an original calculus associated to a chemical abstract machine 
dedicated to service-oriented computing.

The consequence of adopting this approach would be an improvement in the interoperability of services 
and orchestration languages, thus easing the development of composite services.
The high level of abstraction of Criojo could allow developers to write very concise orchestrations since message exchanges are represented in a natural and intuitive way.
